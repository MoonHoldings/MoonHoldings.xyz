        Additional Privacy Information and Your Privacy Rights and Resources
      </h3>

      <strong>Affiliate Use</strong>

      <p>
        We may share Personal Information and other User information among our
        affiliated companies to provide services that you have requested or to
        offer new services or products to you. When we talk about affiliated
        companies, we mean Moon Holdings and its parent company - Panga
        Ventures. Our affiliated companies share our commitment to privacy and
        will not rent, sell or trade your personal information.
      </p>

      <strong>Our Use of Google Analytics</strong>

      <p>
        We use Google Analytics to help us understand how you interact with our
        website and mobile app, market our products and services to you, and to
        improve the User experience. To do this, we share a unique identifier
        with Google. For information on how Google Analytics collects and
        processes data, as well as how you can control information sent to
        Google, see “How Google uses data when you use our partners' sites or
        apps” linked

      </p>

      <h3>Our Use of Tags, Pixels, Cookies and Other Trackers</h3>

      <p>
        Tags, Pixels and cookies are bits of code that we use to gather
        information to operate and measure engagement with our site. These
        generally fall into two categories:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          User Experience - Information that helps us determine which features
          are most popular with our users, provide content and offers that are
          relevant to a user's financial situation or site engagement, market
          our products and services to you, and identify errors or other
          technical issues on our site; and
        </li>
        <li>
          Marketing Attribution - Information that allows us to track the
          effectiveness of advertising we run on other sites and to manage our
          affiliate marketing program. For example, marketing pixels operate by
          sending a small amount of information when triggered by specific
          events, such as when a user registers on our site after clicking
          through a promotional link on another site. To do this, the pixel uses
          a unique identifier that does not contain personally identifying
          information to connect that data (user registration) back to the
          action (clicking on the link).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        To implement the features described above, Moon Holdings contracts with
        trusted service providers to place tags, web beacons, cookies, and
        similar technologies on the Moon Holdings site and applications, which
        collect technical and web navigational information, such as device type,
        browser type, IP address, and pages visited. These service providers are
        prohibited from using any Personal Information they collect on our
        behalf for any purpose other than providing services to Moon Holdings.
        Some of our service providers are members of the Network Advertising
        Initiative, an AdTech self-regulatory organization. You may learn more
        about the Network Advertising Initiative and the opt-out of
        interest-based advertising that they offer by visiting
        <a href="https://thenai.org/opt-out/" target="_bank"
          >https://thenai.org/opt-out/</a
        >
