      <h4>13. Change of Terms</h4>

      <p>
        We may revise this Agreement at any time, and therefore we suggest that
        you check this Agreement from time to time. We may notify you of any
        changes at the e-mail address associated with your Account and you agree
        to accept email communications, links to and/or our posting of any
        revised Agreement on our Dashboard, and you agree that any of these
        means of our communicating a change in the Agreement constitutes
        adequate notice to you. Your continued access or use of the Dashboard or
        any of the Services indicates your agreement to be bound by any such
        revisions.
      </p>

      <h4>14. Indemnification</h4>

      <p>
        You agree to indemnify, defend and hold us and any of our affiliates,
        licensors and agents, and all of their officers, directors, employees,
        agents, information providers and licensors harmless from and against
        any and all third-party claims, damages, liability and costs (including
        attorneys' fees and costs) incurred by any of these parties that arise
        out of or are caused by your use of our Services and/or our Dashboard,
        your violation of this Agreement, your infringement of any intellectual
        property rights, or violation by any user of your Account. In the event
        that there are third party claims against you for which you properly
        seek damages from us under this Agreement, or we are subject to any
        claim for which we have the right to be indemnified by you, we reserve
        the right at our expense in the case of claims by third parties against
        you, and at your expense in the case of claims for which we have the
        right to be indemnified by you, to assume the exclusive defense and
        control of any such claim, and you agree that in any event no such claim
        can be settled without our written consent.
      </p>

      <h4>15. Not a Legal or Tax Advisor</h4>

      <p>
        We make managing your personal crypto portfolio convenient and as
        streamlined as possible. However, neither we nor our Services give,
        offer or render tax or legal advice. Before making financial or
        investment decisions, we recommend that you contact an investment
        advisor, or tax or legal professional. PCAC separately offers and
        provides investment advice.
      </p>

      <h4>16. Waiver and Severability</h4>

      <p>
        We do not waive our rights by delaying or failing to exercise them at
        anytime. If any provision of this Agreement shall be determined to be
        invalid or unenforceable under any rule, law, or regulation of any
        governmental agency, local, state, or federal, the validity or
        enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement shall not be
        affected.
